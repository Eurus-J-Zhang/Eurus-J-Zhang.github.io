              It has been explained to me that a designated researcher will, at my request, provide me with 
              additional details of the general principles of the study and its progress or of the results

              I know that the collected data will not be presented to a third party without my written consent. 
              I know that the research group may ask for a professional consultation on possible unexpected 
              incidental findings without separate consent provided that the anonymity of the results has been 
              ensured. Any type of commercial exploitation of the results is prohibited.
